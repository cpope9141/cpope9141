- 👋 Hi, I’m @cpope9141
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced computer graphics and rendering. I also create art and record music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time ray tracing using Vulkan and getting familiar with Unreal Engine 5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a 2D fighting game that I have built using low level bindings provided by LWJGL 3 (GLFW, Vulkan, OpenAL, ...).
